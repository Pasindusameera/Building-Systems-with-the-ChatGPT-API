# Building Systems with the ChatGPT API  

This repository contains projects and implementations based on **Building Systems with the ChatGPT API**, focusing on automating complex workflows using chain calls to a large language model.  

## Key Learnings & Implementations  

- **Prompt Chaining:** Developing chains of prompts that interact with previous completions.  
- **Python Integration:** Building systems where Python code interacts dynamically with model responses.  
- **Customer Service Chatbot:** Implementing a chatbot utilizing all learned techniques.  

### Practical Use Cases  
- Classifying user queries for chatbot responses.  
- Evaluating queries for safety.  
- Multi-step reasoning with chain-of-thought prompting.  

This hands-on learning experience includes Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and applies real-world AI development techniques.
